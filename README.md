# ExtraMarkups


[Label](https://github.com/chir-set/SlicerExtraMarkups/tree/main/Label/)

This custom markups draws an arrow with a text label by placing usual control points in slice views and 3D views.

[Shape](https://github.com/chir-set/SlicerExtraMarkups/tree/main/Shape/)

This custom markups draws defined primitive shapes (circle, cone...) by placing usual control points in slice views and 3D views.

### Markups application

[StenosisMeasurement3D](https://github.com/chir-set/ExtraMarkups/tree/main/StenosisMeasurement3D/)

This module expects a *Tube* drawn with the *Shape* markups that represents an observer dependent arterial wall, and a *Segment* which is the result of segmenting a contrasted arterial lumen. It can then calculate the lesion volume by subtracting the lumen volume from the wall volume, and hence, determine a volumetric stenosis degree.
